## Installation

### CLI mode (recommended)

After installing, restart your agent and start a new chat:

```
What can I do with with agentcash?
```

### MCP mode

First install the agentcash MCP server:

```bash
npx agentcash@latest install    # interactive
npx agentcash@latest install -y # non-interactive (for agents)
```

Then install the skills:

```bash
npx skills add Merit-Systems/agentcash-skills/mcp --all --yes
```

## Quick Start

### CLI mode

1. **Check your balance:**
```bash
npx agentcash@latest balance
```

2. **Search for a service** (when you don't know which origin to use):
```bash
npx agentcash@latest search "send physical mail"
```

3. **Discover available endpoints** (when you know the origin):
```bash
npx agentcash@latest discover https://stableenrich.dev
```

4. **Check endpoint pricing before calling:**
```bash
npx agentcash@latest check https://stableenrich.dev/api/fullenrich/people-search
```

5. **Make API calls:**
```bash
npx agentcash@latest fetch https://stableenrich.dev/api/pdl/people-enrich -m POST -b '{"profile":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/example"}'
```

### MCP mode

1. **Check your balance:**
```mcp
agentcash.get_balance()
```

If you need deposit links or per-network wallet addresses, call `agentcash.list_accounts()` separately.

2. **Search for a service** (when you don't know which origin to use):
```mcp
agentcash.search(query="send physical mail")
```

3. **Discover available endpoints** (when you know the origin):
```mcp
agentcash.discover_api_endpoints(url="https://stableenrich.dev")
```

4. **Check endpoint pricing before calling:**
```mcp
agentcash.check_endpoint_schema(url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/fullenrich/people-search")
```

5. **Make API calls:**
```mcp
agentcash.fetch(
  url="https://stableenrich.dev/api/pdl/people-enrich",
  method="POST",
  body={"profile": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example"}
)
```

## IMPORTANT: Do Not Guess Endpoints

**Never guess or invent endpoint paths.** All endpoints have specific paths that include a provider prefix:

| Wrong (guessed) | Correct |
|-----------------|---------|
| `/api/people/search` | `https://stableenrich.dev/api/fullenrich/people-search` |
| `/api/people-enrich` | `https://stableenrich.dev/api/pdl/people-enrich` |

If you don't know the exact endpoint path:
1. **Use search** to find the right service by describing what you need
2. **Use discover** to list all available endpoints on a known origin
3. **Consult the skill documentation** (SKILL.md files have correct paths)

Guessing endpoints will result in `405 Method Not Allowed` errors and wasted API calls.

## Funding Your Wallet

If your balance is low:

1. Redeem an invite code: `npx agentcash@latest redeem YOUR_CODE`
2. Or run `npx agentcash@latest accounts` to get Base or Solana deposit links and wallet addresses
